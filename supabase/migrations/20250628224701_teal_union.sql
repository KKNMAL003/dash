  # Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies

  1. Database Changes
    - Remove all problematic RLS policies that cause recursion
    - Disable RLS on tables where admin access is needed
    - Create simple policies that don't query profiles table for role checks
    
  2. Security
    - Temporarily disable RLS on orders, order_items, communication_logs for admin access
    - Keep basic RLS on profiles for user's own data
    - Handle admin access control in application layer instead of database policies
  
  3. Approach
    - Avoid circular dependencies by not checking roles in database policies
    - Use simpler authentication-based policies
    - Let the application handle role-based access control
