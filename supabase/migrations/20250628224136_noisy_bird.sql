  # Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - RLS policies on profiles table were causing infinite recursion
    - The policies were trying to query profiles table from within profiles policies

  2. Solution
    - Remove problematic policies that cause recursion
    - Create simpler policies that don't reference profiles table within profiles policies
    - Use direct auth.uid() checks instead of role-based checks where possible

  3. Security
    - Maintain data access control
    - Allow users to access their own data
    - Allow admin access through simplified policies
