# üì± TestFlight Testing Guide for Push Notifications

## ‚úÖ Yes, TestFlight is Perfect for Testing!

TestFlight builds work perfectly for testing push notifications because:
- ‚úÖ Real push notifications work (unlike iOS Simulator)
- ‚úÖ Uses production APNs certificates
- ‚úÖ Tests the full notification flow
- ‚úÖ Easy to distribute to your team
- ‚úÖ Approved quickly (usually within minutes)

---

## üéØ Complete Testing Flow

### **Step 1: Build and Upload to TestFlight**

If you haven't already uploaded your app to TestFlight:

1. **Open Xcode:**
   ```bash
   npx cap open ios
   ```

2. **Select "Any iOS Device (arm64)" as the build target**

3. **Archive the app:**
   - Product ‚Üí Archive
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Click "Distribute App"
   - Select "App Store Connect"
   - Upload

4. **Wait for processing** (usually 5-15 minutes)

5. **Submit for TestFlight review** (if first time)
   - Usually approved within minutes to a few hours

---

### **Step 2: Install TestFlight Build on iOS Device**

1. **Install TestFlight app** from App Store (if not already installed)

2. **Accept the TestFlight invitation** (sent to your email)

3. **Install your app** from TestFlight

4. **Launch the app**

---

### **Step 3: Enable Push Notifications**

When you first launch the app:

1. **Sign in as an admin user**
   - The app will automatically request notification permissions
   - **Tap "Allow"** when prompted

2. **Verify the device token is registered:**

   The app automatically:
   - Requests notification permissions
   - Registers with Apple Push Notification service (APNs)
   - Gets an FCM token from Firebase
   - Saves the token to Supabase `device_tokens` table

   You can verify this in Supabase:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lnnqoejqgdmwadtzwuix/editor
   - Open the `device_tokens` table
   - You should see a new row with:
     - `user_id`: Your admin user ID
     - `token`: The FCM token
     - `platform`: `ios`
     - `created_at`: Current timestamp

---

### **Step 4: Test Push Notifications**

Now that your device is registered, test the notifications:

#### **Option A: Test with Real Order from User App**

1. **Open your live user app** (the customer-facing app)
2. **Place a test order** as a customer
3. **Within 5-10 seconds**, you should receive a push notification on your TestFlight device
4. **Notification should say:** "New Order Received - Order #[number] from [customer name]"
5. **Tap the notification** - should open the orders screen in your admin app

#### **Option B: Test with SQL Insert**

If you want to test without using the user app:

1. **Go to SQL Editor:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lnnqoejqgdmwadtzwuix/sql/new

2. **Run this SQL:**
   ```sql
   -- Insert a test order
   INSERT INTO orders (
     customer_id,
     customer_name,
     customer_email,
     customer_phone,
     delivery_address,
     delivery_phone,
     total_amount,
     payment_method,
     payment_status,
     status,
     order_number
   ) VALUES (
     (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE role = 'customer' LIMIT 1),
     'Test Customer',
     'test@example.com',
     '+1234567890',
     '123 Test Street, Test City',
     '+1234567890',
     150.00,
     'cash_on_delivery',
     'pending',
     'pending',
     'ORD-TEST-' || floor(random() * 10000)::text
   );
   ```

3. **Check your iOS device** - notification should appear!

#### **Option C: Test Message Notification**

1. **Go to SQL Editor:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lnnqoejqgdmwadtzwuix/sql/new

2. **Run this SQL:**
   ```sql
   -- Insert a test customer message
   INSERT INTO communication_logs (
     customer_id,
     log_type,
     subject,
     message,
     sender_type
   ) VALUES (
     (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE role = 'customer' LIMIT 1),
     'general',
     'Test Message',
     'This is a test message to verify push notifications!',
     'customer'
   );
   ```

3. **Check your iOS device** - notification should appear!

## üêõ Troubleshooting TestFlight Issues

### ‚ùå No notification permission prompt

**Possible causes:**
- You previously denied permissions
- App was already installed before

**Solution:**
1. Delete the app from your device
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí [Your App] ‚Üí Delete
3. Reinstall from TestFlight
4. Launch and allow permissions

### ‚ùå Device token not saved to database

**Check the logs:**
1. Open Safari on your Mac
2. Connect your iOS device via USB
3. In Safari: Develop ‚Üí [Your Device] ‚Üí [Your App]
4. Check console for errors

**Common issues:**
- User is not signed in as admin
- Network connection issue
- RLS policy blocking insert

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if device token exists
SELECT * FROM device_tokens WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- If not, check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM device_tokens; -- Should work if you're admin
```

### ‚ùå Notification not received

**Check in order:**

1. **Device token exists?**
   - Check `device_tokens` table

2. **Webhook triggered?**
   - Check: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lnnqoejqgdmwadtzwuix/integrations/webhooks/webhooks
   - Click on webhook ‚Üí View execution history

3. **Edge Function executed?**
   - Check: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lnnqoejqgdmwadtzwuix/functions/notify-new-order/logs
   - Look for errors

4. **Firebase secrets configured?**
   - Check: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lnnqoejqgdmwadtzwuix/settings/functions

5. **APNs key uploaded to Firebase?**
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
   - Check if APNs Authentication Key is uploaded

### ‚ùå Notification received but app doesn't open correct screen

**Check the notification tap handler:**

The app should navigate based on notification data:
- Order notifications ‚Üí `/orders?id={order_id}`
- Message notifications ‚Üí `/chat?id={message_id}`

**Debug:**
1. Check console logs when tapping notification
2. Verify `data` field in notification payload
3. Check `handleNotificationTap()` function in `src/shared/services/pushNotifications.ts`

---

## üìä What Should Happen (Complete Flow)

### **When a new order is created:**

```
1. Customer places order in user app
   ‚Üì
2. Order inserted into Supabase `orders` table
   ‚Üì
3. Database webhook triggers `notify-new-order` Edge Function
   ‚Üì
4. Edge Function queries `device_tokens` for all admin users
   ‚Üì
5. Edge Function calls `send-push-notification` with order details
   ‚Üì
6. `send-push-notification` gets FCM access token
   ‚Üì
7. Sends notification to Firebase Cloud Messaging
   ‚Üì
8. FCM sends to Apple Push Notification service (APNs)
   ‚Üì
9. APNs delivers to your iOS device
   ‚Üì
10. üîî Notification appears on your TestFlight device!
   ‚Üì
11. You tap the notification
   ‚Üì
12. App opens to orders screen with the new order
```

- [ ] TestFlight app installed and working
- [ ] Admin app installed from TestFlight
- [ ] Signed in as admin user
- [ ] Notification permissions granted
- [ ] Device token saved in `device_tokens` table
- [ ] Platform shows as `ios`
- [ ] Test order triggers notification
- [ ] Notification shows correct order details
- [ ] Tapping notification opens orders screen
- [ ] Test message triggers notification
- [ ] Message notification shows correct content
- [ ] No errors in Edge Function logs
- [ ] No errors in webhook execution logs

## üéØ Testing Multiple Devices

You can test with multiple iOS devices:

1. **Invite multiple testers** to TestFlight
2. **Each tester installs** the app
3. **Each tester signs in** as an admin
4. **Each device registers** its own token
5. **When order is created**, all admin devices get notified!

This tests the real-world scenario where multiple admins receive notifications.

---

## üìù Important Notes

### **TestFlight vs Production**

- TestFlight uses the **same APNs certificates** as production
- Notifications work **exactly the same** as production
- Perfect for testing before App Store release

### **Token Expiration**

- FCM tokens can expire or change
- The app automatically updates tokens when they change
- Old tokens are replaced in the database (upsert on conflict)

### **Background Notifications**

- iOS delivers notifications even when app is closed
- Tapping notification launches the app
- App navigates to the correct screen based on notification data
